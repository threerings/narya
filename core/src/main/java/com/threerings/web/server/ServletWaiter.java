/**

 * game server architecture.
 *
 * <p> We don't want to use service waiters as a permanent solution, as that
 * will result in a zillion servlet threads hanging around waiting for results
 * all over the goddamned place. Instead we want to rearchitect Jetty to
 * support asynchronous servlets that give up their thread when they need to
 * block and grab a new thread out of the pool when they're ready to go
 * again. This is a tall order, but I think they might be working on something
 * like this for Jetty 6.0.
