/**
 * Used to communicate time bases to clients so that more efficient delta
 * times can be transmitted over the network. Two time stamps are
 * maintained: even and odd. When the even time base is sufficiently old
 * that our delta time container (usually a short or an int) will exceed
 * its maximum value, we switch to the odd time base. The bouncing between
 * two separate values prevents problems from arising when the base time
 * is changed, yet values using the old base time might still be
 * propagating through the system.
 *
 * <p> Note that for sufficiently small delta time containers, stale
 * values could still linger longer than the time required for two swaps
 * (two byte delta stamps for example, must swap every 30 seconds).
