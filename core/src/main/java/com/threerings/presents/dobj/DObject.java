/**
 * The distributed object forms the foundation of the Presents system. All information shared among
 * users of the system is done via distributed objects. A distributed object has a set of
 * listeners. These listeners have access to the object or a proxy of the object and therefore have
 * access to the data stored in the object's members at all times.
 *
 * <p> Additionally, an object has a set of subscribers. Subscribers manage the lifespan of the
 * object; while a subscriber is subscribed, the listeners registered with an object will be
 * notified of events. When the subscriber unsubscribes, the object becomes non-live and the
 * listeners are no longer notified. <em>Note:</em> on the server, object subscription is merely a
 * formality as all objects remain live all the time, so <em>do not</em> depend on event
 * notifications ceasing when a subscriber has relinquished its subscription. Always unregister all
 * listeners when they no longer need to hear from an object.
 *
 * <p> When there is any change to the the object's properties (which must be effected via the
 * setter methods), an event is generated which is dispatched to all listeners of the object,
 * notifying them of that change and effecting that change to the copy of the object maintained at
 * each client. In this way, both a repository of shared information and a mechanism for
 * asynchronous notification are made available as a fundamental application building blocks.
 *
 * <p> Distributed object fields can be any of the following set of primitive types:
 * <pre>{@code
 * boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double
 * Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String
 * boolean[], byte[], short[], int[], long[], float[], double[], String[]
 * }</pre>
 * as well as custom types that implement {@link Streamable}.

     * event which can then be committed, dispatching and applying all included events in a single
     * group. Additionally, the events are dispatched over the network in a single unit which can
     * significantly enhance network efficiency.
     *
     * <p> When the transaction is complete, the caller must call {@link #commitTransaction} or
     * {@link CompoundEvent#commit} to commit the transaction and release the object back to its
     * normal non-transacting state. If the caller decides not to commit their transaction, they
     * must call {@link #cancelTransaction} or {@link CompoundEvent#cancel} to cancel the
     * transaction. Failure to do so will cause the pooch to be totally screwed.
     *
     * <p> Note: like all other distributed object operations, transactions are not thread safe. It
     * is expected that a single thread will handle all distributed object operations and that
     * thread will begin and complete a transaction before giving up control to unknown code which
     * might try to operate on the transacting distributed object.
     *
     * <p> Note also: if the object is already engaged in a transaction, a transaction participant
     * count will be incremented to note that an additional call to {@link #commitTransaction} is
     * required before the transaction should actually be committed. Thus <em>every</em> call to
     * {@link #startTransaction} must be accompanied by a call to either {@link #commitTransaction}
     * or {@link #cancelTransaction}. Additionally, if any transaction participant cancels the
     * transaction, the entire transaction is cancelled for all participants, regardless of whether
     * the other participants attempted to commit the transaction.
