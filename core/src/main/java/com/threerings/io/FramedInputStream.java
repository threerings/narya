/**
 * The framed input stream reads input that was framed by a framing output
 * stream. Framing in this case simply means writing the length of the
 * frame followed by the data associated with the frame so that an entire
 * frame can be loaded from the network layer before any higher layer
 * attempts to process it. Additionally, any failure in decoding a frame
 * won't result in the entire stream being skewed due to the remainder of
 * the undecoded frame remaining in the input stream.
 *
 * <p>The framed input stream reads an entire frame worth of data into its
 * internal buffer when <code>readFrame()</code> is called. It then
 * behaves as if this is the only data available on the stream (meaning
 * that when the data in the frame is exhausted, it will behave as if the
 * end of the stream has been reached). The buffer can only contain a
 * single frame at a time, so any data left over from a previous frame
 * will disappear when <code>readFrame()</code> is called again.
 *
 * <p><em>Note:</em> The framing input stream does not synchronize reads
 * from its internal buffer. It is intended to only be accessed from a
 * single thread.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: maybe this should derive from
 * <code>FilterInputStream</code> and be tied to a single
 * <code>InputStream</code> for its lifetime.
